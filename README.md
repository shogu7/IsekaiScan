# IsekaiScan

## About the Project

I started this project to create a manga scan website. I read many manga scans online and I was always curious to know how scan sites work, what difficulties they face, and how they solve these problems. I have created websites before but nothing so complicated; they were all very basic. This is the first time I build a website using all these languages together: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL.

## How It Works

For this project, I created a dynamic website where manga series are automatically fetched and displayed. I used the MangaDex API to retrieve manga series data and integrated it with my website. The database stores all the information for each manga, and every time a new series is added, it is updated automatically in the site using dynamic calls to the database. The website is fully functional, with dynamic features such as filtering and sorting manga based on user preferences.

## Development

I worked on this project intensively for four days and managed to meet the objectives I set for myself. This project helped me improve my web development skills, learn more about VPS management, API handling, and creating dynamic content.
